## 🎯 Next Steps

This is a frontend-only app. To make it fully functional, you would need to:

1. **Add a Backend API** (Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, etc.)
2. **Add Database** (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase, etc.)
3. **Implement Real Authentication** (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
4. **Add Image Upload** (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.)
5. **Real-time Chat** (Socket.io, Firebase Realtime DB, etc.)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
```bash
# Kill the process using port 3000 or change port in vite.config.js
```

**Dependencies issues?**
```bash
npm clean-install
```

## 💡 Tips

- Use the browser's DevTools to see the console
- All data is currently stored in component state (not persisted)
- Refresh the page to reset the app state

Enjoy building your dating app! 💕
